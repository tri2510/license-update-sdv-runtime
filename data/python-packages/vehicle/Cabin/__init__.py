    Attributes
    ----------
    Convertible: branch
        Convertible roof.

        Unit: None

        Number of doors in vehicle.

        Unit: None
    DriverPosition: attribute (string)
        The position of the driver seat in row 1.

        Some signals use DriverSide and PassengerSide as instances. If this signal specifies that DriverPosition is LEFT or MIDDLE, then DriverSide refers to left side and PassengerSide to right side. If this signal specifies that DriverPosition is RIGHT, then DriverSide refers to right side and PassengerSide to left side.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT
    HVAC: branch
        Climate control

        Unit: None
    Infotainment: branch
        Infotainment system.

        Unit: None
    IsAutoPowerOptimize: actuator
        Auto Power Optimization Flag When set to 'true', the system enables automatic power optimization, dynamically adjusting the power optimization level based on runtime conditions or features managed by the OEM. When set to 'false', manual control of the power optimization level is allowed.

        Unit: None
    IsWindowChildLockEngaged: actuator
        Is window child lock engaged. True = Engaged. False = Disengaged.

        Window child lock refers to the functionality to disable the move window button next to most windows, so that they only can be operated by the driver.

        V4.0 branch renamed from "Lights" to "Light" to comply with singular naming of entities. Use SingleConfigurableLight.vspec to describe interior lights that can be configured.

        Unit: None
    PowerOptimizeLevel: actuator
        Power optimization level for this branch/subsystem. A higher number indicates more aggressive power optimization. Level 0 indicates that all functionality is enabled, no power optimization enabled. Level 10 indicates most aggressive power optimization mode, only essential functionality enabled.

        Value range: [0, 10]
        Unit: None
    RearShade: branch
        Rear window shade. Open = Retracted, Closed = Deployed. Start position for RearShade is Open/Retracted.
