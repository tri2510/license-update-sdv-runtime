        Engine configuration.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: UNKNOWN, STRAIGHT, V, BOXER, W, ROTARY, RADIAL, SQUARE, H, U, OPPOSED, X
    DieselExhaustFluid: branch
        Signals related to Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF). DEF is called AUS32 in ISO 22241.

        In retail and marketing other names are typically used for the fluid.

        Unit: None
    DieselParticulateFilter: branch
        Diesel Particulate Filter signals.

        Unit: None
    Displacement: attribute (uint16)
        Displacement in cubic centimetres.

        Unit: cm^3
    ECT: sensor
        Engine coolant temperature.

        Unit: celsius
    EOP: sensor
        Engine oil pressure.

        Unit: kPa
    EOT: sensor
        Engine oil temperature.

        Unit: celsius
    EngineCode: attribute (string)
        Engine code designation, as specified by vehicle manufacturer.

        For hybrid vehicles the engine code may refer to the combination of combustion and electric engine.

        Unit: None
    EngineCoolant: branch
        Signals related to the engine coolant

        Unit: None
    EngineCoolantCapacity: attribute (float)

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: CRITICALLY_LOW, LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICALLY_HIGH
    IdleHours: sensor
        Accumulated idling time during engine lifetime. Definition of idling is not standardized.

        Vehicles may calculate accumulated idle time for an engine. It might be based on engine speed (rpm) below a certain limit or any other mechanism.

        Unit: h
    IsRunning: sensor
        Engine Running. True if engine is rotating (Speed > 0).

        Unit: None
    MAF: sensor

        Unit: Nm
    NumberOfCylinders: attribute (uint16)
        Number of cylinders.

        Unit: None
    NumberOfValvesPerCylinder: attribute (uint16)
        Number of valves per cylinder.

        Unit: None
    OilLifeRemaining: sensor
        Remaining engine oil life in seconds. Negative values can be used to indicate that lifetime has been exceeded.

        In addition to this a signal a vehicle can report remaining time to service (including e.g. oil change) by Vehicle.Service.TimeToService.

        Unit: s
    Power: sensor
        Current engine power output. Shall be reported as 0 during engine breaking.
