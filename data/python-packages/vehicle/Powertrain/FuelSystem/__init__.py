class FuelSystem(Model):
    """FuelSystem model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    AbsoluteLevel: sensor
        Current available fuel in the fuel tank expressed in liters.

        Unit: l
    AverageConsumption: sensor
        Average consumption in liters per 100 km.

        Value range: [0, ]
        Unit: l/100km
    ConsumptionSinceStart: sensor
        Fuel amount in liters consumed since start of current trip.

        A new trip is considered to start when engine gets enabled (e.g. LowVoltageSystemState in ON or START mode). A trip is considered to end when engine is no longer enabled. The signal may however keep the value of the last trip until a new trip is started.

        Unit: l
    HybridType: attribute (string)
        Defines the hybrid type of the vehicle.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: UNKNOWN, NOT_APPLICABLE, STOP_START, BELT_ISG, CIMG, PHEV
    InstantConsumption: sensor
        Current consumption in liters per 100 km.

        Value range: [0, ]
        Unit: l/100km
    IsEngineStopStartEnabled: sensor
        Indicates whether eco start stop is currently enabled.

        Unit: None
    IsFuelLevelLow: sensor
        Indicates that the fuel level is low (e.g. <50km range).

        Unit: None
    IsFuelPortFlapOpen: actuator
        Status of the fuel port flap(s). True if at least one is open.

        Unit: None
    Range: sensor
        Remaining range in meters using only liquid fuel.

        Unit: m
    RefuelPortPosition: attribute (string[])
        Position of refuel port(s). First part indicates side of vehicle, second part relative position on that side.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: FRONT_LEFT, FRONT_MIDDLE, FRONT_RIGHT, REAR_LEFT, REAR_MIDDLE, REAR_RIGHT, LEFT_FRONT, LEFT_MIDDLE, LEFT_REAR, RIGHT_FRONT, RIGHT_MIDDLE, RIGHT_REAR
    RelativeLevel: sensor
        Level in fuel tank as percent of capacity. 0 = empty. 100 = full.

        Value range: [0, 100]
        Unit: percent
    SupportedFuel: attribute (string[])
        Detailed information on fuels supported by the vehicle. Identifiers originating from DIN EN 16942:2021-08, appendix B, with additional suffix for octane (RON) where relevant.

        RON 95 is sometimes referred to as Super, RON 98 as Super Plus.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: E5_95, E5_98, E10_95, E10_98, E85, B7, B10, B20, B30, B100, XTL, LPG, CNG, LNG, H2, OTHER
    SupportedFuelTypes: attribute (string[])
        High level information of fuel types supported

        If a vehicle also has an electric drivetrain (e.g. hybrid) that will be obvious from the PowerTrain.Type signal.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: GASOLINE, DIESEL, E85, LPG, CNG, LNG, H2, OTHER
    TankCapacity: attribute (float)
        Capacity of the fuel tank in liters.

        Unit: l
    TimeRemaining: sensor
        Time remaining in seconds before the fuel tank is empty.

        Unit: s
    Level: sensor
        Level in fuel tank as percent of capacity. 0 = empty. 100 = full.

        Value range: [0, 100]
        Unit: percent
    TimeSinceStart: sensor
        Time in seconds elapsed since start of current trip.

        Unit: s
