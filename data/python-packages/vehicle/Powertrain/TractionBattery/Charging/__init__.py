        Describes how the charging process is controlled. DEACTIVATED means that charging and discharging is deactivated, nothing will happen if charger is connected.

PROFILE means charging is controlled by profile downloaded to vehicle. EXTERNAL_ENTITY means charging/discharging is controlled by the external entity connected to the vehicle. This includes GRID-controlled charging (e.g. ISO 15118), but also other cases where vehicle is connected to an arbitrary load that is powered by the vehicle. MANUAL means manually initiated (plug-in event, companion app, etc). GRID means grid-controlled (e.g. ISO 15118).

        EXTERNAL_ENTITY is the only mode where discharge may occur. The mechanism to provide a profile to the vehicle is currently not covered by VSS.
