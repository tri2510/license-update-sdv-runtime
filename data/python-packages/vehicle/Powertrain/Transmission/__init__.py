    Attributes
    ----------
    ClutchEngagement: actuator
        Clutch engagement. 0% = Clutch fully disengaged. 100% = Clutch fully engaged.

        Value range: [0, 100]
        Unit: percent
    ClutchWear: sensor
        Clutch wear as a percent. 0 = no wear. 100 = worn.

        Value range: [, 100]
        Unit: percent
    CurrentGear: sensor
        The current gear. 0=Neutral, 1/2/..=Forward, -1/-2/..=Reverse.

        Unit: None
    DiffLockFrontEngagement: actuator
        Front Diff Lock engagement. 0% = Diff lock fully disengaged. 100% = Diff lock fully engaged.

        Value range: [0, 100]
        Unit: percent
    DiffLockRearEngagement: actuator
        Rear Diff Lock engagement. 0% = Diff lock fully disengaged. 100% = Diff lock fully engaged.

        Value range: [0, 100]
        Unit: percent
    DriveType: attribute (string)
        Drive type.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: UNKNOWN, FORWARD_WHEEL_DRIVE, REAR_WHEEL_DRIVE, ALL_WHEEL_DRIVE
    GearChangeMode: actuator
        Is the gearbox in automatic or manual (paddle) mode.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: MANUAL, AUTOMATIC
    GearCount: attribute (int8)
        Number of forward gears in the transmission. -1 = CVT.

        Unit: None
    IsElectricalPowertrainEngaged: actuator
        Is electrical powertrain mechanically connected/engaged to the drivetrain or not. False = Disconnected/Disengaged. True = Connected/Engaged.

        In some hybrid solutions it is possible to disconnect/disengage the electrical powertrain mechanically to avoid induced voltage reaching a too high level when driving at high speed.

        Unit: None
    IsLowRangeEngaged: actuator
        Is gearbox in low range mode or not. False = Normal/High range engaged. True = Low range engaged.

        The possibility to switch between low and high gear range is typically only available in heavy vehicles and off-road vehicles.

        Unit: None
    IsParkLockEngaged: actuator
        Is the transmission park lock engaged or not. False = Disengaged. True = Engaged.

        Unit: None
    PerformanceMode: actuator
        Current gearbox performance mode.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: NORMAL, SPORT, ECONOMY, SNOW, RAIN
    SelectedGear: actuator
        The selected gear. 0=Neutral, 1/2/..=Forward, -1/-2/..=Reverse, 126=Park, 127=Drive.

        Unit: None
    Temperature: sensor
        The current gearbox temperature.

        Unit: celsius
    TorqueDistribution: actuator
        Torque distribution between front and rear axle in percent. -100% = Full torque to front axle, 0% = 50:50 Front/Rear, 100% = Full torque to rear axle.

        Value range: [-100, 100]
        Unit: percent
    TravelledDistance: sensor
        Odometer reading, total distance travelled during the lifetime of the transmission.

        Unit: km
    Type: attribute (string)
        Transmission type.

        Unit: None
        Allowed values: UNKNOWN, SEQUENTIAL, H, AUTOMATIC, DSG, CVT
