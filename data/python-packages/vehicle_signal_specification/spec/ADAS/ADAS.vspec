# All Advanced Driver Assist System signals
#
# Three signals are commonly used to describe status of a system.
#
# For systems that only takes action under specific circumstances (like ABS) two signals are often used:
# IsEnabled indicates that the system has been turned on, is monitoring and is ready to take action
# IsEngaged indicates that the system is currently taking action (e.g. regulating brake pressure)
#
# For systems that are taking action over an longer period of time (like Cruise Control) two signals are often used:
# IsEnabled indicates that the system is enabled and available for e.g. configuration, but it is not yet taking action.
# IsActive indicates that the system has been turned on and is continuously taking action,
# (e.g. regulating speed and brakes)

  description: Indicates the currently active level of autonomy according to SAE J3016 taxonomy.
  comment: Follows https://www.sae.org/news/2019/01/sae-updates-j3016-automated-driving-graphic
           taxonomy. For SAE levels 3 and 4 the system is required to alert the driver before it
           will disengage. Level 4 systems are required to reach a safe state even if a driver does
           not take over. Only level 5 systems are required to not rely on a driver at all.
           While level 2 systems require the driver to be monitoring the system at all times,
           many level 2 systems, often termed "level 2.5" systems, do warn the driver shortly
           before reaching their operational limits, therefore we also support the DISENGAGING
           state for SAE_2.
