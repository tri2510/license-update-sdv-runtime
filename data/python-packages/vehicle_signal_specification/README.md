The overall goal of the Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)  is to create a common understanding of vehicle signals in order to reach a “common language” independent of the protocol or serialisation format.

Please find the official documentation at: [Vehicle Signal Specification](https://covesa.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/)

## Getting started

### Discuss all things VSS, "meet" the community
The community has regular calls to discuss topics around VSS. This includes specific tickets in this repository as well as the broader direction in which VSS is evolving.  You can find current call coordinates and dates in [our wiki](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/wiki/Weekly-meeting#meeting).


### Contribute to VSS
Work towards the next version is continuously ongoing in the [master branch](https://github.com/COVESA/vehicle_signal_specification/tree/master)

To work with the specification directly, you need to clone this repository.
